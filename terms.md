Last updated: October 28, 2025

Welcome to DishLens (“we,” “us,” “our”). Please read these Terms carefully. By using DishLens, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.

### 1. Service overview
DishLens lets you scan menu photos to extract dish names and prices, optionally translate names, convert currencies, attach a restaurant, and save menus. Some features rely on third‑party services and on‑device storage.

### 2. Eligibility
You must be able to form a binding contract with us and comply with these Terms and all applicable laws.

### 3. Your content
- You may upload/select photos and enter text. You retain any rights you have to your content.
- You grant us a limited, non‑exclusive license to process your content to operate the service (e.g., send an image to our AI/vision provider to extract items).
- You are responsible for ensuring you have the necessary rights to the content you submit.

### 4. Acceptable use
You agree not to:
- Violate laws or third‑party rights.
- Upload unlawful, infringing, or abusive content.
- Interfere with or disrupt the service, or attempt to bypass limits, security, or rate controls.

### 5. AI and accuracy
- Extraction and translation are AI‑generated and may be inaccurate or incomplete.
- Images shown for dishes are illustrative and may not exactly represent the meal.
- Do not rely on the service for medical, dietary, or allergy decisions without independent verification.

### 6. Third‑party services
DishLens uses third‑party services, including:
- OpenAI (AI extraction, ingredients/allergens suggestions),
- Google Places/Maps/Custom Search/Translate,
- Openverse and Wikimedia (images),
- RevenueCat and app stores (payments).
Your use may be subject to their terms and privacy policies.

### 7. Subscriptions, billing, and free tier
- Free plan includes a limited number of scans per month; limits may change.
- Paid plans are billed through Apple App Store or Google Play (facilitated via RevenueCat).
- Pricing, taxes, renewal, refunds, and cancellation are governed by the applicable app store rules. We do not process or store payment card data.

### 8. On‑device storage
Saved menus and any photos you replace are stored on your device. Clearing data in Settings may delete this content from your device.

### 9. Termination
We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or if we discontinue the service. You may stop using the app at any time.

### 10. Disclaimers
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### 11. Limitation of liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA OR PROFITS, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

### 12. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of your content or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

### 13. Changes
We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
