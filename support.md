### Quick answers (FAQ)
- Scans on Free plan
  - The free plan includes a limited number of scans per month. Upgrade in the onboarding paywall to unlock unlimited scans.
- Images look “generic”
  - Dish images may be illustrative from public sources (Openverse/Wikimedia/Google). Replace any item image with your own in a saved menu.
- Extraction isn’t perfect
  - AI results can be imperfect. Try a clearer, well‑lit photo of a single page, then re‑scan. You can edit names/prices before saving.
- Nearby restaurants aren’t shown
  - Ensure location permission is granted and you have internet connectivity.
- No camera or photo access
  - Grant camera/photos permission in your device settings.
- Translate or currency conversion didn’t work
  - Check your internet connection and try again. Some items without detected currency will not be converted.
- Restore purchases
  - Open the onboarding paywall and tap “Restore membership.” Purchases are managed by the app store.
- Clear my data
  - Go to Settings → Clear Saved Menus (removes menus and internal images) or Clear Saved Polaroids (removes your replaced photos only).

### Tips for better scans
- Use good lighting and fill the frame with the menu page.
- Avoid glare and extreme angles.
- Scan multiple pages if needed, then extract from the combined selection.
