## Data Use & Privacy Policy
Last updated: October 28, 2025

This Policy explains how DishLens (“we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the app.

### 1. What we collect
- Device information: basic device and OS details (for app functionality and diagnostics).
- Location (optional): approximate location when you grant permission, to show nearby restaurants.
- Photos you select: images you choose to scan or to replace dish images in saved menus.
- Derived data: AI‑extracted dish names, prices, translations, and currency conversions.
- Purchase metadata: subscription status via the app store/RevenueCat (we do not receive card data).
- Diagnostics (optional): basic analytics/crash or troubleshooting data if enabled in Settings.
- Support: information you send us when you contact support.

We do not create user accounts and do not require personal identifiers beyond what you voluntarily provide (e.g., your name for personalization).

### 2. How we use information
- Provide and improve features (scan, extract, translate, convert, save, and display results).
- Show nearby restaurants and photos.
- Process payments/entitlements via app stores and RevenueCat.
- Maintain security, prevent abuse, and troubleshoot issues.
- Communicate with you when you contact support.

### 3. Processing with third parties
To operate features, limited data may be sent to:
- OpenAI (menu image/text for extraction; dish name for ingredients/allergens suggestions).
- Google Places/Maps (nearby and text search, place photos), Google Custom Search (dish images), Google Translate (translations).
- Openverse and Wikimedia (dish image lookup).
- RevenueCat and app stores (subscription status and purchases).

Each provider processes data under its own terms/privacy policies.

### 4. On‑device storage and retention
- Saved menus and replaced photos are stored on your device. You can delete them via the app (Settings → Clear Saved Menus/Polaroids) or by uninstalling the app.
- Temporary copies (e.g., processing caches) are kept only as needed to operate the service.
- We do not sell your personal information.

### 5. Data sharing
We share data only:
- With processors listed above to provide features,
- To comply with law or protect rights, safety, and security,
- With your consent.

We do not sell data.

### 6. Security
We use reasonable safeguards appropriate to the nature of the data and our service. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

### 7. Children
DishLens is not directed to children under the age required by applicable law (e.g., 13 or 16). Do not use the app if you are under the applicable age.

### 8. Your choices and rights
- Permissions: You can revoke camera/photos/location permissions in your device settings.
- Data on device: Clear saved menus/photos in Settings.
- Language/Currency: Adjust in Settings or on the results screen.
- Contact us to request deletion assistance related to support communications.

### 9. International transfers
Third‑party providers may process data in other countries. By using the app, you consent to such transfers as permitted by law.

### 10. Changes
We may update this Policy from time to time. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.
